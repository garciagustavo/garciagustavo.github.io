    <h1>Gustavo Henrique Garcia</h1>

    <p>From Piracicaba-SP, starting his fifth and final year in Computer Science at the State University of Campinas
        (UNICAMP). Passionate about distributed systems, networks, and eager to contribute to the implementation of
        systems projects. Available for mobility, relocation or remote work. Seeking a trainee or junior position in
        Engineering or Software Development.</p>

    <ul>

        <li>
            <p>I learned C programming language at the age of 13 and combined high school with a programming coursework a few years later. I had experiences with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL, at that time, and held I tiny business with 6 clients;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>I built a solid theoretical base in computing. I studied digital logic circuits that helped me understand at a low level how the machine executes instructions from electronic signals. From there, I studied the basic organization of computers and how the interactions between devices are made (memory hierarchy, processing pipelines, etc.). I programmed VHDL, to describe hardware for an FPGA. I programmed MIPS assembly for some small projects (traffic light, LED panel with text for buses, etc.), and improved my C language skills;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Implemented C data structure interfaces (list, stack, row, different trees, hash, graphs) and their different methods using pointers, dynamic allocation, etc. Later, I learned how to simulate object orientation in C using function pointers, and how to use the pthreads library for concurrency, in order to make some changes to a micro kernel of an operating system called MINIX. At this stage, I had a lot of contact with the OS modules (processes, memory, I / O, storage, etc.) and understood, theoretically and in the code, the core functionalities. I have a notion of OpenMP for C code parallelization;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>From there, I started to study distributed systems, architectures, fallacies, CAP, processes communicating, consensus, distributed file systems making redundancy, name resolution, coordination, cloud computing, protocols in all network layers (from application layer to physics, with emphasis on TCP and IP protocols) and tools that help in the distribution of the information flow. I studied the documentation of an application that processes batch, called Spark, and presented a seminar on this study;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>I had a solid base in mathematical foundations (proofs and demonstrations by mathematical induction, recurrence, etc.) so that I could later study analysis and design of algorithms, going through dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, order statistics, time analysis, etc;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>I studied probability, statistics, numerical calculus and linear algebra to understand the concepts of low level machine learning and artificial intelligence, the types of learning, and the techniques used. I built some Python scripts using their libraries (numpy, pandas) to analyze tables and matrices, build graphs and do regressions. I trained a simple neural network that delivered a medical patient's diagnosis from a list of symptoms;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>I studied modeling and architecture of a database system, queries and optimizations. I have a notion of software engineering, and of the different basic architectures. I know a little about the transition of the market and the SOA industry to API's and microservices. I have a notion of tests, code design patterns, object-oriented concepts (I know Java), ways to integrate and deliver software for production, containers, orchestrators, queues / messaging, service platforms;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>My research project, during college (Scientific Initiation), was in the area of Distributed Systems and Networks. I worked with masters and doctoral students who were developing a distributed simulator for autonomous vehicular networks. The idea was to use Federated Learning (a learning method created by Google to transfer the processing load from the cloud to the device) to deal with vehicle congestion in an autonomous vehicle network. My job was to find out about the international community that works with vehicular networks and FL, reading and summarizing technical academic articles in the area, national and international, and contributing with C and Python code;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>In my spare time I have been studying the Golang programming language, solving exercises from the reference book, reading codes and getting to know the architecture of Go projects on github. I am writing an TODO List application in Go;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>I try to stay informed about the technology development industry and culture by reading articles and newsletters, listening to national and international podcasts, attending lectures and participating in discussion groups in the software communities;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>I write code using the VSCode text editor, doing the code versioning with Git, on the Linux operating system. I am familiar with the command line, and I learn easily by reading documentation.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Advanced English in reading, writing and speaking.</p>
        </li>
